# GasServiceWeb

### Problem Statement
Develop a Django application to provide consumer services for gas utilities. The application
would allow customers to submit service requests online, track the status of their requests,
and view their account information.

The application would also provide customer support representatives with a tool to manage
requests and provide support to customers.
Here are some specific features that the Django application should include:

1. Service requests: The application would allow customers to submit service requests online.
This would include the ability to select the type of service request, provide details about the
request, and attach files.
2. Request tracking: The application would allow customers to track the status of their service
requests. This would include the ability to see the status of the request, the date and time
the request was submitted, and the date and time the request was resolved.

### Note
To create a support staff account, create a new group "SupportStaff" in Django admin and assign it to a particular user.
